# Casting

R code, scripts, data, figures, and mathematical proofs for the paper "Casting Vector Time Series: Algorithms
for Forecasting, Imputation, and Signal Extraction," submitted for publication at Electronic Journal of Statistics.
Note that the Retail Shoe Store data could not be released, and so the script will not allow for replication.
The Starts data is automatically loaded in the Ecce Signum package, whereas the Dominick data must be manually loaded.
